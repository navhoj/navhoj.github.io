          <p>This study endeavors to investigate the application of machine learning in behavioural economics and behavioural finance to represent a profile of studies conducted in this field. To accomplish this task, 90 scientific studies have been systematically extracted between 2000 and June 1, 2020. Utilizing the text analysis techniques and related statistical methods, the abstracts of the extracted studies have been reviewed and analyzed. First, it was found that attention to this field has developed in recent years with an accelerating trend. Second, it has been demonstrated that specialized journals have also bestowed more curiosity in these studies than in the past by publishing more relevant studies. Third, results revealed that machine learning has been applied in areas such as investor sentiment, decision making, consumer behaviour, trading strategies, game theory, and other areas in the field of behavioural economics and behavioural finance. In this regard, the application of machine learning had been included techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and so on. Despite the expanding consideration adjusted to this field by researchers and specialized journals, there are still many research gaps in this field. Accordingly, there is a relatively significant distance until fully unleashing the superior powers of machine learning, like prediction and classification in behavioural economics and behavioural finance. Finally, this research has completed its mission by suggesting implications for the future of this field based on the acquired outcomes.</p>

          <p>Herding Behaviour and Capital Assets Pricing Model in Tehran Stock Exchange: Evidence from COVID-19 Effects<br>(joint with M Nouri)<br><i>Working Paper: 2021</i></p> 
          <button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
          <div class="panel">
          <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate herding behavior and capital assets pricing model in Tehran Stock Exchange at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a sample of cross-sectional data during 2381 working days of the market (from March 1, 2011, to March 31, 2021), the herding behavior was investigated. We have used cross-sectional absolute deviation (CSAD) as proposed in previous studies to measure securities dispersion from market returns. Furthermore, a regression estimate of a four-factor asset pricing model was applied, in which it takes risk factors as independent variables and incorporates an additional herding factor. The results of the research illustrate that there is a significant relationship between the herding behavior of investors and stock market returns over the entire period under study. In particular, the tendency to herding behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tehran Stock Exchange was confirmed by robust evidence, while in the initial period, this trend was relatively meager.</p>

          <p>Market Efficiency and Adaptability in Tehran Stock Exchange during the outbreak of Coronavirus<br>(joint with F Darzi and M Nouri)<br><i>Working Paper: 2021</i></p> 
          <button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
          <div class="panel">
          <p>The main purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency and market adaptability in the Tehran Stock Exchange during the coronavirus outbreak. In order to achieve the desired results, two static and dynamic approaches have been used (a combination of the state-space approach for GARCH models, and Kalman's filter). The data studied in this research are the total price index data from the daily information of the Tehran Stock Exchange market from the beginning of November 1398 to the end of October 1399. The data are obtained from the official website of the Tehran Stock Exchange Organization. Using the analysis, it was found that the Tehran stock market is not efficient (it is not even weak efficient), but the evidence shows its poor adaptability. Of course, full adaptability can certainly not be acknowledged at this time, and it should be measured retrospectively after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>
